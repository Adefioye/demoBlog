# DEMO BLOG APP

### Components created
- AdminNav


### Pages created
- admin/index.tsx


### Problems tackled
>**Adminbar** loses state when one of the nav items in `collapsed state` is clicked to change to another route or page.
- How do I solve this issue?
- The behavior desired is as thus, in collapsed state, when nav items are clicked upon to change to another route. The admin bar should remain collapsed after rendering a new page.





### TODO for 5/24/2023
1. In `pages/admin` create post/create

2. In `components` create editor/index.tsx
3. In `editor folder`, 
    - create Toolbar.tsx
    - create EditorUtils.tsx
